# nuxt-start-project

Simple application for my learning about handling input, state management, and routing in NuxtJs (Vue), also API requests with Axios (get the Image API from Unsplash)

With this app, you can search for the image that you want, by inputting words (in English) at the input form, then press enter. And gotcha!. You will get a list of images that have themes that match the words that you entered in the form.
